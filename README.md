# Click Bait Addon
The Click Bait Addon for Better Than Wolves allows players to use bait items with right clicking with an unbaited fishing rod while having bait items on their hotbar, circumventing the need to open the crafting GUI.

# Installation
You can install the addon to your Better Than Wolves instance by adding the released .class files to your minecraft.jar, the same way you installed Better Than Wolves.

Note for servers: 
Players without the addon installed will be able to use its functionality on a server with the addon. They will not see their bait disappear immediately, but it will get used up, and eventually disappear from their inventory before they could use it for anything else.

# Using the source code
The source code for the addon is available as a git patch. You can apply it to the decompiled source code of Better Than Wolves using `git apply --directory=src src.patch`. You can find more information about obtaining the decompiled source code [here](https://www.sargunster.com/btw/index.php?title=Creating_Addons).

The patch modifies `ItemFishingRod.java`.
